## Problem Statement
Plant diseases cause major losses in agricultural production. Traditional disease detection methods depend on human observation, which can be slow and inaccurate. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify plant diseases from leaf images, enabling faster and more reliable detection.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Image Processing  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses a plant leaf image dataset containing healthy and diseased samples.

- Dataset Source: Publicly available dataset (Kaggle)
- Image preprocessing includes resizing and normalization

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to large file size.
